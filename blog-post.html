                <h2>Namaste.</h2>
                <p> From my mat, to yours, welcome. Since you're here to learn about who I am, let me tell you how I
                    began my yoga journey.. At the age of 22 I was in a car accident that could have been fatal for me
                    if I didn't have such good fortune or any spirits watching over me.
                    <br><br>
                    To this day I am sincerely thankful that I survived nearly unscathed, and shortly after that I took
                    it upon myself to
                    show gratitude to the Higher Powers of this Universe for letting me continue to be worthy of their
                    love.
                    <br><br>
                    I started going to church for the first time in my life, and was uplifted by the joy and
                    compassionI experienced from the Reverend in my hometown. I may have also been crushing a little too
                    though, as my Reverend was a young, beautiful aboriginal woman and I never thought church would ever
                    be like that. But since then, I have not experienced that same joy and compassion in a service.
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, with my uplifted spirit, inspired to learn more about this Being I was hearing about who
                    goes by the name of God, I went to my local library and started to look up some books on Him.
                    <br><br>
                    My first search attempts were unsuccessful as I tried to find books with the search term 'God', but
                    when I replaced that with 'Soul' I came across a book named "God in All Worlds: An Anthology of
                    Contemporary Spiritual Writing" by Lucinda Vardey.
                    <br><br>
                    I spent months poring over it.
                    <br><br>
                    Some days I would read a few excerpts, other days a few chapters.
                    <br><br>
                    Sometimes I had a hard time digesting the content, and it definitely led me to having a total
                    spiritual crisis. Probably close to a third or halfway through the book was when I found a hidden
                    gem of a thinker and decided YES, I resonate with you.
                    <br><br>
                    His name was Paramhansa Yogananda.
                    <br><br>
                    I still rely heavily on the philosophy of his that was shared
                    through this book. After consistently being reminded throughout the book of how deeply I felt
                    connected to his words, I set myself on the journey to try yoga. My first class really was an
                    awakening for me, as I felt myself in my body for what felt like the first time in my life.
